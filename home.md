We are a group of unofficial maintainers of the CyanogenMod custom ROM for certain Xperia devices. Our aim is to provide better CyanogenMod support for the Xperia Miro, E, J and Tipo.

- Fix camera
- Fix H/W video playback
- Update kernel to kk-2.7
- Use unified kernel for all devices
- Support dual-SIM devices
- Enforce SELinux
- Switch from PMEM legacy HALs to ION HALs (media-caf, display-caf)
